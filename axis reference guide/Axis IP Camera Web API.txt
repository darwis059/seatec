PTZ:

5.3 PTZ
This section describes request for Pan/Tilt/Zoom capable products. Supported requests are however product dependent.

Note! Installing a PTZ driver is done in three main steps:

Upload the driver
Associate the driver with a serial port
Connect cameras to the serial port
PTZ driver update can accomplish step 1 and 2 in one request.
PTZ administration can accomplish step 2 if the driver is already present in the product.
Open serial port accomplishes step 3.

5.3.1 PTZ driver update
Handles installation and removal of PTZ drivers.

Method: POST

Syntax:

http://<servername>/axis-cgi/ptz/ptzupdate.cgi?
[<parameter>=<value>[&<parameter>=<value>...]]
with the following parameters and values

<parameter>=<value>	Values	Description
replacedriver=<string>	Names from the parameter values in group root.PTZ.PTZDrivers.Driver# where '#' denotes the index for the installed driver.	Uninstall currently installed driver <string>. See below for rules concerning driver replacement.
port=<int>	1, ... 1	Associate the driver with this serial port. See below for rules concerning driver replacement.
force=<string>	yes	Force driver installation even if the driver is potentially incompatible with firmware (if for instance a relevant library has been considerably updated) but may still work well. This parameter has no effect on serious incompatibilities such as wrong CPU architecture.
1 Product-dependent. Check the product's specification.

The file content, if any, is provided in the HTTP body according to the format given in RFC1867. The body is created automatically by the browser if using HTML form with input type "file". Empty file content will result in the removal of the driver only.

The following rules apply for driver replacement, in descending order of priority:

If parameter replacedriver is provided, the given driver will be uninstalled.
If parameter port is provided, the driver currently associated with that serial port, if any, is uninstalled.
If the maximum number of installed drivers (equals the number of serial ports) is not reached, no driver is uninstalled.
Any driver not currently associated with any serial port will be uninstalled.
Example:  The driver "Videmech" is currently associated with serial port 1. A client sends this request, where "\r\n" has been omitted in the HTTP body.

POST /axis-cgi/ptz/ptzupdate.cgi HTTP/1.0\r\n
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=AaBo3x\r\n
Content-Length: <content length>\r\n\r\n
--AaBo3x
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="port"

1
--AaBo3x
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Upload Driver"; filename="Philips-1.0.ptz"
Content-Type: text/plain

<file content of Philips-1.0.ptz>

--AaBo3x--
I.e. providing the parameter port=1 together with the file content of the installation file Philips-1.0.ptz for the new driver in the HTTP body. 

This will uninstall the driver "Videmech" and install the "Philips" driver provided in the HTTP body. The new driver is then associated with serial port 1.

 

5.3.2 PTZ administration
Handles relations between a driver and a serial port. When associating a driver with a serial port, any currently associated driver is first disassociated. The new driver is then activated to control units on that serial port. Any disassociated driver is automatically stopped.

Method: GET/POST

Syntax:

http://<servername>/axis-cgi/com/ptzadmin.cgi?
<parameter>[=<value>][&<parameter>=<value>...]
with the following parameters and values

<parameter>=<value>	Values	Description
port=<int>	1, ... 1	Selects the serial port.
ptzdrivername=<string>	Name of a driver from values in parameter group root.PTZ.PTZDrivers	Associates a driver name with a serial port. If "none" the current driver (if any) is disassociated from the serial port.
1 Product-dependent. Check the product's specification.

Example: Associate driver "Videmech" with serial port 2.

http://myserver/axis-cgi/com/ptzadmin.cgi?port=2&ptzdrivername=Videmech


5.3.3 PTZ control
To control the Pan, Tilt and Zoom behavior of a PTZ unit, the following PTZ control URL is used. This URL has view access rights.

Important: 
Some PTZ units automatically reduce pan and tilt movements as the zoom factor increases. Therefore, the actual movement may be less than what is requested of these units.
The PTZ control is device-dependent. For information about supported parameters and actual parameter values, please check the specification of the Axis PTZ driver you intend to use. The following table is only an overview.

Note:
The URL must follow the standard way of writing a URL, (RFC 2396: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Generic Syntax); that is, spaces and other reserved characters (";", "/", "?", ":", "@", "&", "=", "+", "," and "$") within a <parameter> or a <value> must be replaced with %<ASCII hex>. For example, in the string My camera, the space will have to be replaced with %20, My%20camera.

Method: GET/POST

Syntax:
